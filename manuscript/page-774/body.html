<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Domesday the scribes abandoned the idea of transcribing the original returns in full, and contented themselves with giving a <em>pr√©cis</em> of them; the details which had been collected about sheep and horses are jettisoned and the whole survey is drawn within closer limits. The most reasonable explanation of this change is that the so-called second volume of Domesday represents the first attempt at a codification of the returns; that the result was found too detailed for practical purposes, and that the conciser arrangement of the first volume was adopted in consequence. The volume combining Essex, Norfolk, and Suffolk contains 450 folios and even the Conqueror might have been appalled at the outcome of his survey if all the thirty counties of England were to be described 489on the same scale. Whatever the reason, the change is accompanied by a marked improvement in workmanship and practicability.</p></div> </div>
